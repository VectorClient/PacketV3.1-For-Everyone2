# Launcher

I noticed some pepole getting crashed for the standalone dll, so I decided to make launcher to inject automatically 2 dlls to avoid uwp restrictions.

After build this project, place "packetv3.dll" and "loader.dll" into same directory to work. (You can find a dll of packetv3 from `loader/resource` and rename it)
